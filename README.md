How to print the particular character from certain text?
Challenge = "I will win"
print(Challenge[7:10])
Print the length of Character:
Challenge = "I will win"
print(len(Challenge))
Convert String into lower character;
Challenge = "I will win"
print(Challenge.lower())
String Concatenation – Joining two strings
a = "30 Days"
b = "30 hours"
c = a + b
print(c)
Adding space during concatenation 
a = "30 Days"
b = "30 hours"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
casefold() - Usage
text = "Thirty days and Thirty hours"
x = text.casefold()
